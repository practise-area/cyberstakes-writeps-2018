### Description:

Further recon has identified a data indexing service at challenge.acictf.com:14000 that looks vulnerable... See what you can do with the [server](https://challenge.acictf.com/static/99f6afe500df514ef395cf6107effeb9/codeserver) we managed to leak!

### Hints

 - There's an array being accessed. Look at how the array is being accessed. Is there anything wrong there?
 - Look at the memory around the array. Is there anything of interest?
 - Keep endianness and the size of your overwrites in mind!

### Solution
