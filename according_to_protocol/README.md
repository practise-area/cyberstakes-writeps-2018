# According to Protocol - Points: 150

### Description:

We've captured some network traffic, but it looks like they're using a custom protocol. We managed to obtain a program that handles the protocol, can you take it from here? Grab the Packet Capture (challenge.pcap). We also managed to leak their server (bserver) and even their CRT (libc.so).

### Hints

 - The provided packet capture is of communication between the client and server.
 - Analyze the server to determine how the communication happens and what it means!
 - The server is runnable, you can try communicating with it locally.

### Solution

TODO

### Flag: `TODO`
