# Say as I say, not as I do - Points: 150

### Description:

We found a custom service at challenge.acictf.com:61713. Our analysts think that the service might be vulnerable, see if you can compromise it. Binary: registrar, libc: libc.so

### Hints

 - Address space randomization is disabled, so ASLR-you up to the challenge?
 - Historically, libc has been a good source of both ROP gadgets and utility functions.
 - Getting remote access to the host will make obtaining the flag trivial.

### Solution

TODO

### Flag: `TODO`
